Live in the moment
Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.
The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart.
Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.
When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.
The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision.
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.
Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow.
Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.
I long to accomplish a great and noble task, but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble.
We could never learn to be brave and patient if there were only joy in the world.
The world is moved not only by the mighty shoves of the heroes but also by the aggregate of the tiny pushes of each honest worker.
No pessimist ever discovered the secret of the stars or sailed an uncharted land, or opened a new doorway for the human spirit.
The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
Face your deficiencies and acknowledge them, but do not let them master you. Let them teach you patience, sweetness, insight.
Knowledge is love and light and vision.
Although the world is full of suffering, it is also full of the overcoming of it.
One can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar.
I am only one, but still I am one. I cannot do everything, but still I can do something; and because I cannot do everything, I will not refuse to do something that I can do.
The highest result of education is tolerance.
It's wonderful to climb the liquid mountains of the sky. Behind me and before me is God and I have no fears.
The best way out is always through.
Life is a succession of lessons which must be lived to be understood.
It is a terrible thing to see and have no vision.
I believe in the immortality of the soul because I have within me immortal longings.
It is not possible for civilization to flow backward while there is youth in the world. Youth may be headstrong, but it will advance its allotted length.
Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.
I can see, and that is why I can be happy, in what you call the dark, but which to me is golden. I can see a God-made world, not a man-made world.
What we once enjoyed and deeply loved we can never lose, for all that we love deeply becomes part of us.
We would never learn to be brave and patient if there were only joy in the world.
Security is mostly a superstition. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.
The highest result of education is tolerance.
The marvelous richness of human experience would lose something of rewarding joy if there were no limitations to overcome. The hilltop hour would not be half so wonderful if there were no dark valleys to traverse.
The highest result of education is tolerance.
No pessimist ever discovered the secret of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new doorway for the human spirit.
When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.
I am only one, but still I am one. I cannot do everything, but still I can do something; and because I cannot do everything, I will not refuse to do something that I can do.
The best way out is always through.
The welfare of each is bound up in the welfare of all.
Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light.
We could never learn to be brave and patient if there were only joy in the world.
The world is moved along, not only by the mighty shoves of its heroes but also by the aggregate of tiny pushes of each honest worker.
The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart.
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.
Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.
Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.
The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision.
Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow.
Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.

To live for the hope of it all
I hate stupid people
Have courage and be KIND
The Earth does not belong to us: we belong to the Earth. Vaquita belongs to the sea; let’s ensure it remains free.
In the dance of life, the Vaquita is a graceful partner. Let's not allow this dance to end.
Protecting the Vaquita is not just about saving a species; it’s about preserving the harmony of the ocean’s symphony.
The beauty of the ocean lies in its biodiversity. Save the Vaquita, preserve the melody of the deep.

kidney function is not a right, but a provilege
Team Cries At Books
Customers are not right on my shift
Don't Waste Your Potential Neuron
Born to slay forced to work

you aren't actually
Hot Girls Read Smut
I'd rather be fishing
i just like smiling
Not all treasure’s silver and gold, mate
Live a Life Worth Dying For
Honk If You're Horny
Whatever Floats Your Goat
The Faster We Come
Don't Call Anybody
Don't Believe Everything You Think.
Back Off I Have a crazy Sister
Dont stop until you are proud
my life is a mess
hold on i see a dog
Part of the journey is the end
always cold, so cold
through love all is possible
STAY SINGLE ANTI VALENTINE

I Just Wanna Give You The Creeps
Don’t Believe Everything You Think
