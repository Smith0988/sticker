Live in the moment
Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.
The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart.
Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.
When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.
The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision.
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.
Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow.
Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.
I long to accomplish a great and noble task, but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble.
We could never learn to be brave and patient if there were only joy in the world.
The world is moved not only by the mighty shoves of the heroes but also by the aggregate of the tiny pushes of each honest worker.
No pessimist ever discovered the secret of the stars or sailed an uncharted land, or opened a new doorway for the human spirit.
The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
Face your deficiencies and acknowledge them, but do not let them master you. Let them teach you patience, sweetness, insight.
Knowledge is love and light and vision.
Although the world is full of suffering, it is also full of the overcoming of it.
One can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar.
I am only one, but still I am one. I cannot do everything, but still I can do something; and because I cannot do everything, I will not refuse to do something that I can do.
The highest result of education is tolerance.
It's wonderful to climb the liquid mountains of the sky. Behind me and before me is God and I have no fears.
The best way out is always through.
Life is a succession of lessons which must be lived to be understood.
It is a terrible thing to see and have no vision.
I believe in the immortality of the soul because I have within me immortal longings.
It is not possible for civilization to flow backward while there is youth in the world. Youth may be headstrong, but it will advance its allotted length.
Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.
I can see, and that is why I can be happy, in what you call the dark, but which to me is golden. I can see a God-made world, not a man-made world.
What we once enjoyed and deeply loved we can never lose, for all that we love deeply becomes part of us.
We would never learn to be brave and patient if there were only joy in the world.
Security is mostly a superstition. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.
The highest result of education is tolerance.
The marvelous richness of human experience would lose something of rewarding joy if there were no limitations to overcome. The hilltop hour would not be half so wonderful if there were no dark valleys to traverse.
The highest result of education is tolerance.
No pessimist ever discovered the secret of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new doorway for the human spirit.
When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.
I am only one, but still I am one. I cannot do everything, but still I can do something; and because I cannot do everything, I will not refuse to do something that I can do.
The best way out is always through.
The welfare of each is bound up in the welfare of all.
Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light.
We could never learn to be brave and patient if there were only joy in the world.
The world is moved along, not only by the mighty shoves of its heroes but also by the aggregate of tiny pushes of each honest worker.
The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart.
Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.
Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.
Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.
The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision.
Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow.
Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.

To live for the hope of it all
I hate stupid people
Have courage and be KIND
The Earth does not belong to us, we belong to the Earth. Vaquita belongs to the sea; let’s ensure it remains free.
In the dance of life, the Vaquita is a graceful partner. Let's not allow this dance to end.
Protecting the Vaquita is not just about saving a species; it’s about preserving the harmony of the ocean’s symphony.
The beauty of the ocean lies in its biodiversity. Save the Vaquita, preserve the melody of the deep.

I told my wife she was drawing her eyebrows too high She looked surprised

I'm on a seafood diet I see food and I eat it
Campers don't just go outdoors; they become part of the outdoors
Adventure is calling, but my bed has a pretty convincing argument against it
Camping, Where s'mores turn into a well-balanced breakfast, and granola bars are considered dessert
The horizons are endless, explore them with relentless curiosity

The best therapy is forest therapy—found at a campsite near you
Camping is the only time I consider 'roughing it' as no room service
Adventure awaits at the end of every trail Lace up your boots

In the great outdoors, discover the greatness within yourself
My idea of roughing it is a hotel without Wi-Fi
Fearless adventurers leave footprints where others fear to tread
Camping turns ordinary days into extraordinary stories around the campfire
Break boundaries, embark on a journey that transcends limits
Why do we cook bacon and hot dogs over a fire but bake cookies in an oven? Camping philosophy

I only need three things in life, Food, Wi-Fi, and a convincing reason to leave my couch

I'm not clumsy; I'm just testing gravity, and it still works
Find your wild, pitch a tent, breathe the air, live the adventure
My dog used to chase people on a bike It got so bad, I had to take his bike away
Embrace the journey, for in it lies the essence of true adventure
Camping is just a way to turn a regular weekend into a story-worthy adventure
In every camper's heart, nature finds a forever home
You don't have to, you get to
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me

I'm not lazy, I'm in energy-saving mode
I'm not antisocial, I'm selectively avoiding stupidity
Cancelled my subscription to adulthood
Eating snacks and ignoring texts

Haters gonna hate, potatoes gonna potate
Flexing like my Wi-Fi signal
Life's a mess, and so is my hair
My room's a mess, but so is my life
Mood swings and chicken wings
Procrastinating like there's no tomorrow
Caffeine and sarcasm, my only filters
I'm not lazy, I'm in energy-saving mode, indefinitely

Maybe Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more
I'm speaking in rhyme!
Faith is believing in things when common sense tells you not to
And the us's heart grew three sizes that day
let think of something he hadn't before
Every Who down in here liked Christmas a lot
Max, help me... I'm feeling!
What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more
Why, for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!
Stink, stank, stunk!
welcome Christmas, Christmas Day
What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store
You're a mean one
Maybe Christmas doesn't come from a store.
It's not what's under the Christmas tree that matters
He puzzled and puzzled till his puzzler was sore
I must stop this whole thing.
