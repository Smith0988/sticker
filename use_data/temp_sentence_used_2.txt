i love to make boys cry
Even Duct Tape Can't Fix Stupid
Sore today Strong Tomorrow
Have Courage and Be Kind
Old But Not Obsolete
Life is Short and So Am I
What We Do In The Shadows
no rain no flowers
Today I will be positive
no regrets only memories
tomorrow is another day
Read Books Be Kind Stay Weird
Everyone is replaceable
we took a chonce
The Place of Dead Roads
Do It For The Plot
The Head and the Heart
Together we are unlimited
I Don't Care What You Think
Dont Let pigeon drive the bus
Good Things Take Time
when they go low, we go high
I Can Be Totally Flexible
You're not the pepper
I'm silently judging you
I am a Woman Phenomenally.
Remind Yourself, Life is a Test
You have a place in my heart
