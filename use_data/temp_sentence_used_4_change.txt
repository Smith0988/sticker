The Earth does not belong to us: we belong to the Earth. Vaquita belongs to the sea; let’s ensure it remains free.
In the dance of life, the Vaquita is a graceful partner. Let's not allow this dance to end.
Protecting the Vaquita is not just about saving a species; it’s about preserving the harmony of the ocean’s symphony.
The beauty of the ocean lies in its biodiversity. Save the Vaquita, preserve the melody of the deep.
