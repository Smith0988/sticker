All people are born as originals
why would you lie to me
We are best friends because everyone else sucks!

Plot Plan Strategize Organize Mobilize
Dance Teacher Dancers Are My People square
do you like fish sticks joke
History, huh? Bet we could make some

Life Happens, Coffee Helps Sunflower
The Mountains Are Calling And I Must Go
You're Amazing Keep That Shit Up
We're all just walking each other home
words are our most inexhaustible source of magic
hope is the only thing stronger than fear
Ain't No Mountain High Enough!
i'm not convinced I know how to read
Intelligence without Ambition
Never memorize something that you can look up
oh yeah, terribly funny really witty
sorry i'm late i didn't want to come
She Leaves A Little Sparkle Wherever She Goes
Read The Constitution 
you got a dope soul and hella ethics
