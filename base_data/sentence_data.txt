Maybe Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more
I'm speaking in rhyme!
Faith is believing in things when common sense tells you not to
And the us's heart grew three sizes that day
let think of something he hadn't before
Every Who down in here liked Christmas a lot
Max, help me... I'm feeling!
What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more
Why, for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!
Stink, stank, stunk!
welcome Christmas, Christmas Day
What if Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store
You're a mean one 
Maybe Christmas doesn't come from a store. 
It's not what's under the Christmas tree that matters
He puzzled and puzzled till his puzzler was sore
I must stop this whole thing.
