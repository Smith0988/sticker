We Are the Choices We Make
Very lovely morning try not to kill yourself today
Where you lead, I will follow
You My Friend Should Have Been Swallowed
LIVE A LIFE YOU WILL REMEMBER 
do small things with great love
When Hell Freezes Over I'll Ski There Too
Double, Double Toil & Trouble
don't be a dick 
Sadness is looking at ourselves 
she was made of sunlight
We Can, We Will, We Must
Hell is Other People 
Can We Fix It?
No I have not been duck hunting, you fucking hillbilly
Its a beautiful day to save lives
There will be a line
I need to go to my mind palace!
you know, Iâ€™m something of a scientist myself 
You are my sunshine 
What A Time To Be Alive
Mindset Is Everything
English Is Important But Economics Is Importanter
by what right does the wolf judge the lion
stars, can't do it. not today
in my life, i'll love you more
I have to return some video tapes movie
Jesus loves you, but I'm his favorite
How will I ever get out of this labyrinth!
It Really Do Be Like that Sometimes 
Sounds like a personal problem to me
Maybe Broccoli Doesn't Like You Either
On Wednesdays We Wear Pink
I DON'T KNOW HER
Don't believe everything you think
Dance Like No One Is Watching
I need coffee in an I.V
Mother, Should I Trust the government?
Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast 
I'm here because you broke something
Intelligence is lethal 
If I cannot move heaven, i will  raise hell
Sometimes Life is a Bitch
i am burdened with glorious purpose
i want a dog
Where Focus Goes, Energy Flows
FIND JOY IN THE JOURNEY
