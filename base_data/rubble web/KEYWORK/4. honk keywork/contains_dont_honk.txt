don't honk at me I'm sensitive
don't honk at me im popping my pimples

don't honk at me I'm anxious 
don't honk at me i'm trying my best
don't honk at me I am fragile
don't honk at me i'm crying already
don't honk at me I'm easily frightened 
don't honk at me I'm driving home from my lobotomy
don't honk at me if you exist
don't honk at me i will panic 
don't honk at me I'm probably already crying
don't honk at me i will spell my beer
don't honk at me I'm trying my best
don't honk at me I'm just a little guy
don't honk at me loser i'm going shopping
